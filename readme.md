This git repository contains Supplementary Information to the publication 
“Can deep learning algorithms enhance the prediction of solute descriptors for linear solvation energy relationship approaches?”:


-	Prediction_solute_descriptors_singletask.py

-	Prediction_solute_descriptors_multitask.py

-	Dataset_and_predictions.xlxs



We used DeepChem library for model development. 
The full code for the DNN development is given 
at the GIT repository of DeepChem https://github.com/deepchem/deepchem. 

Our adapted code is provided here in Prediction_solute_descriptors_singletask.py and 
Prediction_solute_descriptors_multitask.py.

Corrections to the Absolv dataset, the finally used dataset and resulting predictions for all datasets 
are listed in Dataset_and_Predictions.xlxs.
